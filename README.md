My makeup project looks at the millions of dollars traded in beef and veal across the United States from 2000 to 2024. The beef industry is a significant part of the U.S. economy, influencing agricultural practices, trade policies, and consumer behavior. Understanding the patterns in beef trading can provide insights into economic trends, regional production strengths, and market demands. The goal of this dashboard is to illustrate the trends of beef & veal trading with interactive dashboards that can be filtered by yearly or state trends. I learned that having multiple forms of filters, buttons, visualizations, and trends demonstrate data in a fun and knowledgable way. 

The audience may include economists, farmers, meat producers, distributors and supply chain managers who want to look at trends state-by-state for the beef market in order to make data-driven decisions.

The value of the Dash App lies within the interactive map with the slider that allows the user to look at trends over time and hovering over states to see the values and the changes that take place. Also, the line graph page that shows the difference in trade values over time is useful because you can select the specific state you want to look at with the dropdown menu at the top of the page. These interactive visualizations and filters allow the user to find exactly what they're looking for.
